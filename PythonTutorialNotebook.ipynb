In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.<br>\n",

    "- Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use UpperCamelCase for classes and lowercase_with_underscores for functions and methods. Always use self as the name for the first method argument (see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.\n",

However, aliasing has a possibly surprising effect on the semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as lists, dictionaries, and most other types. This is usually used to the benefit of the program, since aliases behave like pointers in some respects.
